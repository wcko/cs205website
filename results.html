          <h4>Station Data over a Week</h4>

          <div class="span6">Key Data Insights:
               <ul>
               <li>Time seems to be a good predictor of daily and weekly traffic.
               <li>The relationship between time and traffic is highly nonlinear & periodic in days and
weeks.
               <li>Weekend days have obviously different traffic patterns than weekdays.
               <li>While stations appear to follow similar patterns over time, some experience much more traffic, more variance in traffic, or both compared to others.
               </ul> </div></div>

<h4>Model Fitting: Observed Traffic vs Predicted Traffic</h4>
Using 7th order
polynomial GLM regression on time of day + all dummy interactions for weekday/weekend and
location:<br>Leftmost plots are predicted traffic vs. all weekday traffic <br> Center plots are predicted traffic vs. all weekend traffic <br> Rightmost plots are predicted traffic vs. all weeks of traffic
<img src="images/regressed_graph.jpg" class="img-polaroid"><br>
After we have generated our regressions, we have verified the equation (red line) by plotting against the observed data. We see that the equation fits the overall shape of the observed traffic points. <br>Our script that downloads real-time data also appends new observations to the existing files that are used in regression analysis. In this way, we continually update our regression.
<br>
We use a model like those shown above at each location on the map to predict traffic. To see this in action, check out <a href="prediction.html">Predicted Traffic</a>.

<h4>Reflections</h4>
This project was a challenging, yet rewarding exercise in applying the parallel computational techniques we have learned in order to analyze "big data". As parallel computation is an immature field, at times it was frustrating to work with poor documentation and limited examples. However, this is also the reason it is exciting. Mainstream social science has not yet utilized parallel computational techniques. We hope to innovate new tools and expand the breadth of techniques for the field.
